      <h3>Hi! My name is Gulyuza Whalen!</h3>
      <p>I'm currently studying at Thinkful to be a software engineer.</p>
      <p>I chose to be a software engineer for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I enjoy writing a code and seeing it live on the Internet;</li>
        <li>It makes me happy to collaborate with like-minded people to achieve a common goal;</li>
        <li>I appreciate the atmosphere of creativity at software companies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In my free from studying time I like to read fiction and knit to give my mind a break from mental work.</p>
      <p>I'm located in Pittsburgh, PA!</p>
